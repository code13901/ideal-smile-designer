## ‚úçÔ∏è Gemini Integration Write-up (200 words max)

Our application leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview's advanced multimodal capabilities in a innovative two-step process:

**Step 1 - Professional Dental Analysis:** Gemini analyzes uploaded smile photos to assess tooth alignment, spacing, color, gum line symmetry, and overall smile characteristics. The AI provides detailed professional feedback similar to a dental consultation.

**Step 2 - Ideal Smile Design Generation:** Using the analysis context, Gemini generates a photorealistic "ideal smile design" that maintains the person's natural facial features while optimizing dental aesthetics. This showcases the model's ability to understand complex visual relationships and create targeted improvements.

The app demonstrates Gemini's unique strengths in:
- **Image Understanding:** Accurately identifying dental features and aesthetic issues
- **Contextual Generation:** Using analysis insights to inform image creation
- **Consistency Maintenance:** Preserving facial characteristics while making specific improvements
- **Professional-grade Output:** Creating realistic, natural-looking results

This wouldn't be possible with simple text-to-image models - it requires Gemini's sophisticated understanding of facial anatomy, dental aesthetics, and the ability to make precise, contextual modifications while maintaining photorealistic quality.
